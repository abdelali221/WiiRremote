# WiiRremote

Use your Wii sensor bar as a remote control!

# How to use :

The app requires a code file (codes.dat) which you neeed to create using the tool provided (DATEditor).

Make sure to use the correct protocol when creating a code.

When you get the codes.dat file ready, put it in the same folder as the .dol file (generally apps/WiiRremote) and launch the app on your console.

Note: The app requires both a real console and a wired ir bar, otherwise it won't work.
